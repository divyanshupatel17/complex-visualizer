0. SUPER EASY METHOD (FOR COMPLETE BEGINNERS)
==================

Here's the absolute easiest way to get started:

1. INSTALL PYTHON:
   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
   - Click the big "Download Python" button
   - Run the installer
   - IMPORTANT: Check "Add Python to PATH" ✓
   - Click "Install Now"

2. RUN THE PROGRAM:
   - Right-click in the complex-visualizer folder
   - Select "New" → "Text Document"
   - Delete the default text and copy-paste this EXACT text:

@echo off
echo ============ COMPLEX VISUALIZER ============
python --version > nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Python is not installed! Please install Python first.
    pause
    exit /b
)
pip install streamlit numpy scipy pandas plotly pillow matplotlib
streamlit run app.py
pause

   - Save the file as "START_HERE.bat" (make sure to include the .bat extension)
   - Double-click the "START_HERE.bat" file

That's it! The application will install everything needed and open in your web browser automatically.

(If you encounter any issues, read the detailed sections below)

==================
1. QUICK START GUIDE
==================

For the simplest way to run the application:

1. Make sure Python is installed (see Section 2 below if you need to install it)
2. Create a file named "run_visualizer.bat" in the project folder with the content from Section 4
3. Double-click on the "run_visualizer.bat" file 
4. The script will automatically check your Python installation, install dependencies, and start the application

That's it! If you encounter any issues, follow the detailed steps in the next sections.

==================
2. DETAILED INSTALLATION STEPS
==================

STEP 1: INSTALL PYTHON
----------------------
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Click the "Download Python" button (use the latest version, Python 3.10 or higher)
3. Run the downloaded installer
4. During installation, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"
5. Click "Install Now"

STEP 2: VERIFY PYTHON INSTALLATION
----------------------------------
1. Press Win+R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog
2. Type "cmd" and press Enter to open Command Prompt
3. Type the following command and press Enter:
   python --version
4. You should see the Python version displayed. If not, restart your computer and try again.

STEP 3: CREATE REQUIREMENTS FILE
--------------------------------
1. Open Notepad or any text editor
2. Copy and paste the following text:

streamlit>=1.26.0
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0
pandas>=1.5.0
plotly>=5.13.0
pillow>=9.4.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0

3. Save the file as "requirements.txt" in your project folder

STEP 4: INSTALL REQUIRED LIBRARIES
----------------------------------
1. Open Command Prompt (as you did in Step 2)
2. Navigate to the project folder by typing:
   cd path\to\complex-visualizer
   (Replace "path\to\complex-visualizer" with the actual path to the folder)
3. Install all required libraries at once by typing:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   (If for any reason that doesn't work, you can install them individually with:
   pip install streamlit numpy scipy pandas plotly pillow matplotlib)

STEP 5: RUN THE PROJECT
----------------------
1. In the same Command Prompt window, type:
   streamlit run app.py
2. After a moment, your default web browser should automatically open with the application running
3. If the browser doesn't open automatically, the Command Prompt will display a URL (like http://localhost:8501) - copy and paste this URL into your web browser

STEP 6: USING THE APPLICATION
----------------------------
1. The application will display in your web browser
2. Use the sidebar on the left to navigate between different visualizations
3. Input matrices and vectors as needed for each visualization
4. Explore the different visualization options and interactive features

CLOSING THE APPLICATION
----------------------
To stop the application:
1. Return to the Command Prompt window (or batch file window)
2. Press Ctrl+C
3. Close the browser tab

REOPENING THE APPLICATION LATER
------------------------------
To run the application again later:
1. Either double-click the "START_HERE.bat" file again
   OR
2. Follow the manual steps:
   a. Open Command Prompt
   b. Navigate to the project folder using the cd command
   c. Type: streamlit run app.py

==================
3. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
==================

COMMON PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS FOR BEGINNERS:

• "Python is not installed!" message:
  - Make sure you followed Step 1 in the Super Easy Method
  - During Python installation, be sure the "Add Python to PATH" box was checked
  - Restart your computer and try again

• Black window appears and disappears instantly:
  - Right-click on the START_HERE.bat file
  - Select "Run as administrator"

• Application doesn't open in browser:
  - Look in the black command window for a URL (http://localhost:8501)
  - Open your web browser manually and paste this URL

• "Importing" or "ModuleNotFound" errors:
  - Run START_HERE.bat again to ensure all libraries are installed

If you encounter any other errors:

1. "Command not found" or similar errors:
   - Make sure Python is correctly installed and added to PATH
   - Try restarting your computer and Command Prompt

2. Import errors:
   - Run the pip install command from Step 4 again to ensure all libraries are installed

3. Browser doesn't open:
   - Copy the URL shown in Command Prompt and paste it into your browser manually

4. Application crashes:
   - Check the error message in Command Prompt
   - Make sure you've installed all required libraries
   - Try restarting the application

5. Finding your project folder path:
   - Open File Explorer
   - Navigate to the complex-visualizer folder
   - Click in the address bar at the top
   - Copy the path that appears (e.g., C:\Users\username\Desktop\complex-visualizer)
   - Use this path with the cd command in Step 4

==================
4. BATCH FILE CONTENT (FOR ADVANCED USERS)
==================

If you want to create the full automated batch file with more detailed checks, create a new text file, copy the content below, and save it as "run_visualizer.bat" in your project folder:

===== START OF BATCH FILE CONTENT =====
@echo off
echo ====================================
echo Complex Visualizer - Startup Script
echo ====================================
echo.

echo Checking Python installation...
python --version > nul 2>&1
if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo Python is not installed or not in PATH!
    echo Please install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    echo Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
    pause
    exit /b
)
echo Python is installed. Good!
echo.

echo Installing required libraries...
pip install -r requirements.txt
if %ERRORLEVEL% neq 0 (
    echo There was an error installing required libraries!
    echo Trying to install them individually...
    pip install streamlit numpy scipy pandas plotly pillow matplotlib
)
echo.

echo Starting Complex Visualizer application...
echo The application will open in your default web browser.
echo.
echo To stop the application, return to this window and press Ctrl+C, then close your browser.
echo.
streamlit run app.py

pause
